That is small comfort, however, given that their acid, venom, claws and teeth provide them many other ways to kill.\nBasilisks love dark, damp places such as cellars, caves and city sewers. They hunt by day, waiting patiently in hiding for their prey to come, then jump out in a flash to unleash a deadly attack.\n" +

For this reason many men, their courage girded by goldlust, take to hunting them. Most of these hunts end in disaster, " +
